## Goal

he project was to find out which holidays affected the sales most in given stores data which identify Christmas and Thanksgiving. I used basic data processing, data visualization, and data cleaning to remove bad values and I used Power BI for a few visualizations.

So this project aims to produce insights into the impact of holidays on sales which can be used in the future to improve sales
